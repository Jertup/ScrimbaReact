# Scrimba React Course Projects

This repository contains my project folders for the online course **Scrimba React**.

## Getting Started

To run the app:

```bash
# Using npm
npm install
npm start
```

```bash
# Using Yarn
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Accessing Projects

Once the app is running (default port: **8000**), you can access individual projects at:

```
http://localhost:8000/[course part]/[the project]
```

**Example:**  
To view the "ChefClaude" project from Part 3, go to:  
```
http://localhost:8000/Part3/ChefClaude
```
